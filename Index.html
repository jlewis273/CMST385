        <h2>The Band</h2>
        <p>
            Huey Lewis & the News are a bar band that made good. With their simple,
            straightforward rock & roll, the San Francisco-based group became one of America's most
            popular pop/rock bands of the mid-'80s. Inspired equally by British pub rock and '60s R&B and rock & roll,
            the News had a driving, party-hearty spirit that made songs like "Workin' for a Livin'," "I Want a New Drug,"
            "The Heart of Rock & Roll," "Hip to Be Square," and "The Power of Love" huge hits. At its core, the group was
            a working band, and the bandmembers knew how to target their audience, connecting squarely with odes to nine-to-five
            jobs and sports. As the decade progressed, they smoothed out their sound and by the mid-'90s took time off from recording.
            Nevertheless, the News remained a popular and perennial concert draw, essentially carrying on in bar band fashion, reappearing
            every so often with solid albums like 2001's Plan B and the 2010 Stax Records tribute Soulsville.
            Following a 2018 announcement that Lewis was losing his hearing due to Ménière's disease, the band's future seemed uncertain, though they made a comeback in 2020 with their tenth album, Weather.
