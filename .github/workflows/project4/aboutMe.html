                I started my journey as an Intelligence Analayst with the US Army where I was priviledged to
                serve my country in Europe by supporting our military interests and leading soldiers.

                My natural enjoyment for problem solving and
                learning lead me to the field of software development where I get to apply my skills and learn new ones as a junior .NET developer!

                Some of my hobbies include traveling, hiking with my wife and German Shepherd, and attending live shows with friends and family.
                My favorite book genres range from history, politics to sports and sci-fi/fantasy novels. I also collect Marvel comic books as you can probably guess.

        <h4>Why I built this website</h4>
        <p>I started this project to sharpen my progamming skills and to find a way to record my comic book collection. </p>
